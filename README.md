# Echoes of Chimera

_A First-Person Modern Horror Game Developed As A Class Project_

Rated: M (Mature)

Ages: 14+

Set Release: 12/2025 

## About the Game

Echoes of Chimera puts you in the shoes of **Adam**, an ex-marine and government agent. 

Your mission: infiltrate an abandoned research facility, **Quantum Laboratory**, to retrieve documents related to **Project Chimera**.

However, the facility is not empty. Failed experiments—mutated creatures—roam the halls, turning your mission into a struggle for survival. As you navigate the decaying environment, you'll uncover the horrifying truth behind the project, forcing a moral decision: deliver the dangerous findings to your superiors or bury them forever.

## Core Gameplay

### `Stealth & Evasion`
Survival depends on avoiding detection. Enemies patrol and react to sound. You must use different techniques as you progress, as creatures have varying abilities like enhanced hearing and night vision.

### `Audio Design`
Sound is your primary tool. Listen for the distinct noises of the creatures to predict their movements. Be cautious, as every action you take—stepping on glass or opening a door—creates sound that can attract them.

### `Resource Management`
Resources are scarce. You have a handgun with limited ammo, a flashlight with a finite battery, a multi-tool, and a few medical supplies. Every decision on how and when to use these items is critical. However, there will be resources around the facility for you to find. 

## Project Goals

Our objectives for this class project include:

* **`Prototype Development`**: Create a playable prototype demonstrating the core gameplay loop.
* **`AI Implementation`**: Implement enemy AI with sound-based detection.
* **`Narrative Integration`**: Weave the story into the gameplay through discovered documents and audio logs.
* **`Technical Execution`**: Showcase proficiency in game design principles and engine capabilities.

Echoes of Chimera is a project focused on building a tense, atmospheric horror experience that prioritizes strategic thinking and survival over combat.
